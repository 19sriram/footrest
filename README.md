# Japanofun

This project is for fun yet using responsivevoice.js which connects the dot for my autism project for kids. Here the normal name will be converted to japanese alphabet project which I found online.
  Not sure why it is not saying it in a vocal way.
  
 Try to convert your normal name into japenese alphabetical order. Won't say it in a meaningful way. There is always a start for everything and this proves to be useful in a way for it.
 
 Have fun :) Happy coding :)
